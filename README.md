# Traffic Counting with Computer Vision
Currently, this repository consists of 2 separated branches
- [Main_Files](https://github.com/GroovyRice/computerVisionTrafficCounting/tree/Main_Files): This section houses all the files that make the program run. Different versions will be categorised into folders.
- [Learning](https://github.com/GroovyRice/computerVisionTrafficCounting/tree/Learning): This section contains various files from exemplar code relating to OpenCV and Deep Learning practise. It allows for easy reflection.

## REQUIRED
**Python**: install [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**PyCharm**: this IDE will allow you to easily pull the Git repository, alternatively you can just use it to compile within a separate _Project_. This can be installed from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

**Numpy**: after installing Python run this in _Command Prompt_ `pip install numpy` makesure you have version 1.21.4 check this in the Python console by typing

> `import numpy as np`<br/>
> `print(np.__version__)`

**OpenCV**: similarly `pip install opencv-contrib-python` if this doesn't work just use `pip install opencv-python`<br/>
If you struggle installing please don't hesitate to email me.
